## Instructions

Before we continue with your application, we have prepared this simple frontend test for us to check how you code. Please follow these instructions and upload the code in any `private repository` or `private gist`. If possible, please also include a link to a demo somewhere like `codepen` or `jsfiddle`.

1) Create a responsive page in a modern JavaScript framework (e.g. React or Vue.js)
2) The page must switch between the below layouts depending on the screen width. When the screen is larger than `600px` the desktop layout should be used, and when it is smaller the mobile layout should be used. Note that the exact size and spacing of boxes doesn't matter, please use your own judgement and make something with a consistent and simple layout that looks essentially like the example
3) When *any* box is clicked, the colours of *all* boxes should be shuffled randomly (either to another colour in a fixed list of possibilities, or to any random colour - up to you)
4) You can use any styling solution for CSS (plain CSS, CSS-in-JS, etc)

Feel free to include comments to explain the intentions or thoughts behind what you're doing, and please get in touch if you have any questions.

Good luck! がんばってください！
